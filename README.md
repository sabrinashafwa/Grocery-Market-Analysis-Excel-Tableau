# Grocery-Market-Analysis
This project delves into the dynamics of the grocery market, leveraging data to uncover trends and patterns in consumer behavior. By analyzing customer data, we aim to:
- Platform Preference by Age: Unveil which platforms (physical stores, online grocery delivery, etc.) resonate most with different age groups.
- Complaint Analysis: Identify platforms that generate the most customer complaints, enabling actionable insights for improvement.
- Grocery Category Breakdown: Visualize the quantities of groceries purchased within each category (meat, fruits, fish, etc.), providing a clear picture of consumer habits.
- Customer Background Insights: Explore how grocery shopping patterns vary based on customer demographics (education, marital, income, etc.), revealing valuable customer segments.

Data Preparation:
Data for this project is prepared using Microsoft Excel. Spreadsheets facilitate data cleaning, organization, and transformation, ensuring a well-structured foundation for analysis.

Data Visualization:
Tableau serves as the primary tool for data visualization in this project. Its interactive dashboards and charts empower us to present insights in a clear, compelling, and easily digestible manner.
